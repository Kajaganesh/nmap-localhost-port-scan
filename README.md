# Port Scanning on Local System using Nmap

## Project Description
This hands-on beginner project demonstrates how port scanning is performed on a local system using Nmap. The goal of this project is to understand open ports and running services from a security perspective.

## Tool Used
- Nmap (Zenmap GUI)

## Scan Target
127.0.0.1 (Localhost)

## Scan Types Performed
- Intense Scan
- Quick Scan

## Steps Performed
1. Installed Nmap on Windows
2. Opened Zenmap GUI
3. Scanned localhost (127.0.0.1)
4. Observed open ports and services
5. Analyzed scan results

## Observations
- Some ports were open on the local system
- Open ports indicate running services
- Port scanning helps identify potential attack surfaces

## Screenshot

## What I Learned
- What port scanning is
- How Nmap works
- Importance of identifying open ports
- Basics of network security assessment

## Disclaimer
This scan was performed only on the local system for educational purposes.
